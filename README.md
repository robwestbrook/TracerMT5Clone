This is a clone for the MT-5 meter, used by many of the Tracer MPPT Solar Charge Controllers. At the moment, I'm protoyping with an Arduino Uno, Rev. 3. I'm using a 20x4 LCD display, which is connected the Arduino through a shift register. A 4x4 membrane keypad is connected through a MCP23017 I2C port expander. The actual communication with the Tracer(mine is a 2210) is done through a software serial port.
